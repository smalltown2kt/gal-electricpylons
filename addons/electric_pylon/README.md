# Electricity Pylons

Copyright 2025 smalltown2kt

## Contents

This project contains a 3D asset of an electricity pylon in a lattice tower style. Though not designed to a specific example, the style is broadly equivalent to a UK-typical 6-arm high-voltage grid transmission tower.

The asset scene is set up with basic ground-level colliders for the corner struts. The mesh itself is low poly (300) being formed of a double-sided mesh and partial transparancy material/textures.

By using the pylon tower with appropriate meshes to link them, a wire network can be illustrated:

Asset is set up in a scene in the ./parts/ folder. Demo scenes which were used to generate the project screenshots have been included.

## Support

If you find my assets useful, I'd love a coffee!
